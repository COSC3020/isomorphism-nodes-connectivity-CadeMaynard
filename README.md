# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

## Proof:

For a graph to be completely connected each vertex must have an edge that leads to every other vertex which means that every vertex in the graph must be equivalent to every other vertex, because every vertex has the same number of edges. Since we know that $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and we know that each vertex within both of those graphs has the same number of edges, then any order of vertexes in $A$ can be mapped to any order of vertexes in $B$ and because these graphs are fully connected this will be a proper, isomorphic mapping.
